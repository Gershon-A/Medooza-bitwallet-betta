To require the mandrill library and initialize it with\nyour account API key:\n\n    var mandrill = require('node-mandrill')('<Your Api Key Here>');\n\nTo make a call to the API, call the `mandrill` function.  For example:\n\n    //send an e-mail to jim rubenstein\n    mandrill('/messages/send', {\n        message: {\n            to: [{email: 'git@jimsc.com', name: 'Jim Rubenstein'}],\n            from_email: 'you@domain.com',\n            subject: \"Hey, what's up?\",\n            text: \"Hello, I sent this message using mandrill.\"\n        }\n    }, function(error, response)\n    {\n        //uh oh, there was an error\n        if (error) console.log( JSON.stringify(error) );\n\n        //everything's good, lets see what mandrill said\n        else console.log(response);\n    });\n\n> ### Arguments\n> **mandrill(*string: api-endpoint*, *object: options*, *[function: callback]*)**\n>\n> **mandrill(*string: api-endpiont*, *function: callback]*)**\n>\n> **Api Endpoint**: The REST url for the API you want to access.  By default,\n> all requests are made requesting JSON as the response format.  If you'd like\n> to utilize a different format, you cann append `.yaml`, `.php`, or `.xml` to\n> the endpoint uri.  Node-mandrill will parse json responses and pass them to\n> the callback, but the other formats will be passed back as a string.\n>\n> **Options**: A javascript object defining the options as needed for the\n> requested API endpoint.  *note*: your API key is not required here, as the\n> module will automatically append it to your request.  However, you can\n> override your configured key by passing a value for a new key, using the\n> `key` index of the options object.\n>\n> **Callback**: A function reference for a function to call upon completion of\n> the request.  It should accept 2 arguments.\n>\n> > **error**: if an error occurred (either with the HTTP request, or within\n> > the Mandrill API) the error will be passed back in this argument.

You'll\nneed to install jasmine-node to run the tests.\n\nOnce jasmine is installed, you will need to edit the `spec/mandrill.spec.js`\nfile to reflect your Mandrill API key, and an email address to receive your\ntest e-mail on.  These two settings are at the top of the file.  Once they're\nin place, run your tests by doing:\n\n    $ ./test.sh\n\nOn your command line.
